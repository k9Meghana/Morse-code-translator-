# Morse code Translator

## What is Morse code?
Morse code is a method of *encoding* letters, numbers and symbols into sequences of **dashes(-)** and **dots(.)**.
Each character in Morse has unique pattern of dots and dashes.

## Why Morse code?
It was developed by **Samuel Morse** and **Alfred vail** in 1830's for ***telegraph system***.
Before phones and internet,people are used to sned over long distances using ***Electric signals*** through wires.

## What is Morse code translator?
A Morse code translator is device that converts or ***decodes*** messages between morse code to text and vice versa.
* Morse code can be transmitted using 
- Sound
- lights 
- taps
- Electric power

# Uses of Morse code Today:

## Emergency Communicaton:

* It can be sent with *fash lights*, *whistles* ,*tapping* when voice is not possible.
* sos = ... --- ...  is universal distress signal.
* sms = ... -- ... 
* Underwater communication (Example: Via sonar)

## Accessibility:
 
* people with disabilities can use blink detection, switches, or tapping to communicate.
* Then the detected data is sent to Morse Translators that converts their input to readabe message.

## Amateur Radio (Ham radio) Communication:

* Morse code is popular among Ham Radio operators because 
- It requires less bandwidth
- so, it can travel long distances with less power.

## Military and Aviation uses:

* It is used for signalling in military, aerospace, and aviation fields when other methods fails.

* These morse code translators are essential for decoding these signals in real time.


## project Components:

* Arduino uno
* Lcd display
* Push buttons
* Led light
* Resistors
* jumper cables


## program code:
 
 * In this project, I have used 3 methods to convert Morse code to text.
 * I have given tapping input through  a push button and diplayed the entered morse code and converted output in lcd display.
 * Similarly, I have given blink input through another push button and diplayed the output
 * text input is given through serial Monitor and the output is displayed in lcd.

 ## Conclusion:
Morse code, despite being one of the oldest forms of Digital communication, contiues to prove its relevences in modern times and to its simplicity,reliability and versatality.
A morse code translator showcases how the classic communication system can be integrated with modern technology using microcontrollers like Arduino, Raspberry pi and etc...
This translator bridges the gap between old communication methods and new-age innovation ,making all it as a valuable tool for education and Real world problem-solving.
